# Arbitary-Precision-Calculator
🎯 Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) using DSA

“Perform arithmetic on numbers of any size—precision, efficiency, and modularity combined.”

🚀 Project Overview

The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C-based application that allows arithmetic operations on numbers far larger than standard data types (like int or long).

Standard C data types cannot handle numbers beyond a fixed limit (e.g., int max ~2 billion). APC overcomes this by storing numbers in data structures (arrays, linked lists, or stacks), enabling operations on numbers with hundreds or even thousands of digits.

This project is designed with modularity and clarity in mind: the main program, core arithmetic logic, and utility functions are in separate files. This makes the project easy to maintain, extend, and reuse.

✨ Features

Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division supported.

DSA-driven logic: Efficient use of arrays, linked lists, or stacks.

Menu-driven interface for easy use.

Modular code: clean separation of logic, utilities, and interface.

Includes sample input files for quick testing.
